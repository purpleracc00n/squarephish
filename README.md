# Fork Updates

- Removed some odd default headers and added referrer-policy: no-referrer to avoid leaking our URLs when redirecting
- Added support for file of targets so it can send emails to multiple emails at the same time
- Added a simple check to prevent spamming a target with code emails if a scanner accesses the QR URL multiple times. Only sends an email every 15 minutes.
- Changed QR code URLs for better opsec
	- removed port and always implying 443 (HTTPS)
	- changed endpoint with a random string
	- ~~base64d~~AES128 encrypt the email address
- Changed logging to get the remote addresses from x-forwarded-to header, supporting fronting reverse proxies.
- Added support for events and tracker for the initial email
	- Email Opened
	- QR Accessed / Clicked Link
	- Authentication Complete (when a token is saved to disk)
- Added Slack events update integration (similar to what Gophish has). Also added more details (Country, ISP) by looking up the IP and by using a user agent parser. 
- Added more pretexts that are not signatured
- Added option for logging into file 
- Added option for delay between emails sent

## ToDOs
- Improve error handling
- Make sure Code emails are not sent again within a timespan of 15 minutes if the link is accessed again (happens when the links are scanned by automated email security tools)

## Other useful Microsoft Applications apart from Authenticator:
- Microsoft Authentication Broker (29d9ed98-a469-4536-ade2-f981bc1d605e)
	- Register or join a device to Azure AD if we don’t already have access to a device in the tenant.
	- Use the refresh token to ask for a PRT.
	- If the user performed “fresh” MFA when authenticating with the device code flow, we can also register WHFB credentials on their account for persistence.

# SquarePhish

SquarePhish is an advanced phishing tool that uses a technique combining the OAuth Device code authentication flow and QR codes.

> See [PhishInSuits](https://github.com/secureworks/PhishInSuits) for more details on using OAuth Device Code flow for phishing attacks.

SquarePhish -- v0.1.0

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit

modules:
  {email,server}
    email         send a malicious QR Code email to a provided victim
    server        host a malicious server QR Codes generated via the 'email' module will 
                  point to that will activate the malicious OAuth Device Code flow
```

## Attack Steps

An attacker can use the `email` module of SquarePhish to send a malicious QR code email to a victim. The default pretext is that the victim is required to update their Microsoft MFA authentication to continue using mobile email. The current client ID in use is the Microsoft Authenticator App.

> By sending a QR code first, the attacker can avoid prematurely starting the OAuth Device Code flow that lasts only 15 minutes.

<img src="resc/1st_email.png" width="400"/>

The victim will then scan the QR code found in the email body with their mobile device. The QR code will direct the victim to the attacker controlled server (running the `server` module of SquarePhish), with a URL paramater set to their email address.

<img src="resc/qrcode.png" width="400"/>

When the victim visits the malicious SquarePhish server, a background process is triggered that will start the OAuth Device Code authentication flow and email the victim a generated Device Code they are then required to enter into the legitimate Microsoft Device Code website (this will start the OAuth Device Code flow 15 minute timer).

<img src="resc/2nd_email.png" width="400"/>

The SquarePhish server will then continue to poll for authentication in the background.

```

The victim will then visit the Microsoft Device Code authentication site from either the link provided in the email or via a redirect from visiting the SquarePhish URL on their mobile device.

<img src="resc/mssite.png" width="400"/>

The victim will then enter the provided Device Code and will be prompted for consent.

<img src="resc/consent.png" width="400"/>

After the victim authenticates and consents, an authentication token is saved locally and will provide the attacker access via the defined scope of the requesting application.

# Usage

> !IMPORTANT: Before using either module, update the required information in the [settings.config](settings.config) file noted with `Required`.

## Email Module

Send the target victim a generated QR code that will trigger the OAuth Device Code flow.

```
usage: squish.py email [-h] [-c CONFIG] [--debug] [-e EMAIL]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        squarephish config file [Default: settings.config]

  --debug               enable server debugging

  -e EMAIL, --email EMAIL
                        victim email address to send initial QR code email to

  -u URL, --url URL     force a url to use, this will override the default
                        and will not work with default device flow or
                        pretext but can be useful if using squarephish to
                        send lures directing targets to other servers
```

## Server Module

Host a server that a generated QR code will be pointed to and when requested will trigger the OAuth Device Code flow.

```
usage: squish.py server [-h] [-c CONFIG] [--debug]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        squarephish config file [Default: settings.config]

  --debug               enable server debugging
```

## Configuration

All of the applicable settings for execution can be found and modified via the [settings.config](settings.config) file. There are several pieces of required information that do not have a default value that must be filled out by the user: SMTP_EMAIL, SMTP_PASSWORD, and SQUAREPHISH_SERVER (only when executing the email module). All configuration options have been documented within the settings file via in-line comments.

**Note**: The `SQUAREPHISH_` values present in the 'EMAIL' section of the configuration should match the values set when running the SquarePhish server.

```conf

SMTP_PORT            = 465                                                                      # SMTP port, defaulted to 465

```

## Custom Pretexts

Currently, the pre-defined pretexts can be found in the [pretexts](pretexts/) folder.

To write custom pretexts, use the existing template via the [pretexts/iphone/](pretexts/iphone/) folder. An email template is required for both the initial QR code email as well as the follow up device code email.

**Important**: When writing a custom pretext, note the existence of `%s` in both pretext templates. This exists to allow SquarePhish to populate the correct data when generating emails (QR code data and/or device code value).


## OPSEC

There are several HTTP response headers defined in the [utils.py](squarephish/utils.py#L28) file. These headers are defined to override any existing Flask response header values and to provide a more 'legitimate' response from the server. These header values can be modified, removed and/or additional headers can be included for better OPSEC.

```json
{
    "vary": "Accept-Encoding",
    "server": "Microsoft-IIS/10.0",
    "tls_version": "tls1.3",
    "content-type": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
    "x-appversion": "1.0.8125.42964",
    "x-frame-options": "SAMEORIGIN",
    "x-ua-compatible": "IE=Edge;chrome=1",

}
